### Who?

I’m 22 years old and a software engineer at Apple. I program cool things, spend a lot of time outdoors, play guitar, and recently started writing a blog called <a href="https://buttersword.mataroa.blog" target=None>buttersword</a>. My academic focus at my alma mater Northeastern was AI and Game Theory, but I took inspiration from Stanford's symbolic systems program in my major design, meaning I've spent solid research time in philosophy, mathematics, and psychology as well. 

I’ve done a number of cool things in my professional life so far, such as owning a core backend product for connected devices at <u>Apple</u>, writing code for bidding on Google ads at <a href="/pages/wayfair">Wayfair</a> on a team that brought in over $5M/day, helping source biotech startups for a budding <a href="/pages/boom">venture capital firm</a>, and running AI events in <a href="/pages/ollms">San Francisco</a> and New York City. Even as the most junior guy, I'm used to coming in low and rapidly ramping up my responsibilities by being fast and dependable.

I was raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, surrounded by startup culture, which left me with a love for technology and a high level of independence. I also think it gave me a knack for asking good questions and an eye for excellence. 

### A Note

I just made a fun little project to help improve at guitar! Check it out <a href="/scales">here</a>. Will probably keep adding to it over time.
