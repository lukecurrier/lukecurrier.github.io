### Who?

I’m a 22-year old senior at Northeastern University studying computer science.  My academic focus is AI and game theory, but I've designed my degree around a symbolic systems program, meaning that I've spent time in philosophy, mathematics, and psychology as well. 

I’ve done a few cool things in my professional life so far, like writing code for bidding on Google adwords at <a href="/pages/wayfair">Wayfair</a> on a team that brought in over $5M/day, helping source startups for a <a href="/pages/boom">venture capital firm</a>, and running AI events in <a href="/pages/ollms">San Francisco</a> and New York City. Even as the most junior guy, I'm used to coming in low and rapidly ramping up my responsibilities by being fast and dependable.

I was raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, surrounded by startup culture, which left me with a love for technology and a high level of independence. I also think it gave me a knack for asking good questions and an eye for excellence. 

In my free time I make music, travel, read sci-fi, and play ultimate frisbee.
