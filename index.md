### Who?

I’m a 21-year old senior at Northeastern University studying computer science.  My academic focus is AI and human-computer interaction, and I’ve spent time in <a href="/pages/dtrd">game theory</a>, philosophy, <a href="/pages/forex">economics</a>, and psychology. 

I’ve done a few cool things in my professional life so far, like writing an AI project for bidding on Google adwords for <a href="/pages/wayfair">Wayfair</a> that spent over $1M/day, helping source startups for a <a href="/pages/boom">venture capital firm</a>, and running <a href="/pages/ollms">AI hackathon events</a> in San Francisco. Even as the most junior guy, I'm used to coming in low and rapidly ramping up my responsibilities by being fast and dependable.

I was raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, surrounded by startup culture, which left me with a love for technology and a high level of independence. I also think it gave me a knack for asking good questions and an eye for excellence. 

In my free time I read sci-fi novels, make music, and play ultimate frisbee and tennis.
