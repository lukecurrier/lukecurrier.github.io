In my Junior summer at <a href="/pages/neu/">NEU</a>, I was accepted to a Dialogue of Civilizations program: a 1-month experience taking two classes abroad. I chose to spend my time in Sydney, Australia studying software engineering with the fantastic Ian Gorton. 

While in Sydney, UTS was our home base, and for one of our two classes groups of students from the dialogue undertook research projects for UTS faculty (mine was <a href="/pages/forex/">predicting foreign exchange trading profits</a> using machine learning).
