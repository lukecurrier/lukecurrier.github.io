**Academics**: <br>
I was accepted as an Early Decision applicant from <a href="/pages/wps/">Woodside Priory</a> to study Psychology as part of the class of 2025. In my first semester, I studied abroad in Dublin at UCD, learning about psych, music, and philosophy. Upon returning to Boston in the spring I switched my major to Business in a search to learn about the world in new ways. 

Having been raised in Palo Alto by one <a href="https://www.nfx.com/team/james-currier">hell of a father</a>, though, I found that most of what I was learning felt superficial and decided to focus on a skill - the most important skill for the modern day, in my opinion, is Computer Science. After falling in love with logic, though, and driven by a desire to continue learning about people and the world, I added Philsophy to create a dual major inspired by <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Stanford's Symbolic Systems program</a>. 

Since then, I've been delightedly learning about object-oriented design, algorithms for machine learning, software engineering, and all sorts of other fun topics. As a member of the <a href="https://honorsprogram.sites.northeastern.edu">honors program</a> I've also enjoyed the opportunity to take seminars and classes designed to spark my interest in all sorts of topics, such as debating. 

In the summer of 2024, I did a second study abroad at UTS in Sydney, Australia, working on software engineering and AI training. 

I aspire to be a lifelong learner, and Northeastern's flexible academics have given me an incredible springboard to do just that. 

**Extracurriculars**: <br>
I'm an active guy. It's a regular tradition of mine to join as many clubs as possible at the beginning of each semester, and then keep one or two as time goes on based on my interest. I've met too many interesting people and done too many interesting things to list them all here, but some highlights are below.

Distilled Harmony A Cappella is my biggest commitment and closest-knit community. I've been a singer all my life, and being able to focus that interest into a flourishing social life is a dream. Listen to us <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2oYLwmWHaHrK4suIVZh8SU?si=onWYwynpRKm06WwEnaS75A">here</a>, and read more about my experience with DH <a href="/pages/dh.md">here</a>. 

I'm a big sports player, and Northeastern's frisbee team is top notch - being able to play on the club team and travel across New England to play against other schools has been a huge part of my college career. I also have played a number of other sports as intramurals, such as volleyball, soccer, and squash. 

Joining <a href="/pages/ambassadors.md">Husky Ambassadors</a> was a great part of the second half of my college career. I love talking to people about my school, and it's been fun to find yet another social pool. 

There's more, but I doubt you want to listen to me ramble on about them, so ask me in person sometime! I hope to keep adding things to my list - maybe some writing, maybe some tennis, maybe some startups... who knows??


**Projects**: <br>
Side projects make the world go 'round! The two I'd call out as my largest ones are my <a href="/pages/dtrd.md">replicator dynamics research</a> with Rory Smead and my time spent working on <a href="/pages/lp.md">LearnPrompting</a>. 

Since taking DS3000, though, I've had a love for creating little apps in python and messing around with machine learning and spreadsheets. I built a program to record, transcribe, and summarize lectures for easy note-taking, created a detailed and fully automated spreadsheet to track my finances, and made this site!

Outside of programming, I love making music, and have been working on something fun outside of my normal activities with a cappella - hopefully, more on that soon.
