subtitle: Leading tours, meeting people, answering crazy questions

In my first couple of years at Northeastern, I showed people around my dorm and helped them get acquainted with Boston as they considered applying to the school. I've always loved answering questions for and showing secrets to friends of friends, and it was a joy like no other to get a text from someone telling me they got in and they can't wait to see me in September. In the fall of 2023, I figured I might as well do it officially. 

After being accepted to the program in the spring of 2024, I worked as a tour guide showing prospective and admitted families into Northeastern. There's just something about getting people's energy up and sharing with them something I love. It was such a great job, and I love the people I've met through the program. It showed me the power a single person can have when all they do is put on a smile and bring someone else a positive experience. 

If you ever have any questions about Northeastern, I consider the role a lifetime gig. Feel free to reach out via the socials below - it would be my pleasure to answer them!
