Since my first couple of months at Northeastern, I've been showing people around my dorm and helping them get acquainted with Boston as they consider applying to the school. I've always loved answering questions for and showing secrets to friends of friends, and it's a joy like no other to get a text from someone telling me they got in and they can't wait to see me in September. In the fall of 2023, I figured I might as well do it officially. 

Since spring 2024, after being accepted to the program, I've worked as a tour guide showing prospective and admitted families into Northeastern. Something about getting people's energy up and sharing with them something I love (because Northeastern truly is an awesome school) is such a great job, and I've loved the people I've met in the program. It's showed me the power a single person can have when all they do is put on a smile and bring someone else a positive experience. 

If you ever have any questions about Northeastern, feel free to reach out via the socials below - it's my pleasure (and my job) to answer them!
