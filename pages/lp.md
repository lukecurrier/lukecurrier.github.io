subtitle: Accidentally creating a nonprofit out of thin air

<a href="https://learnprompting.org">LearnPrompting</a> is an online nonprofit resource for learning about interacting with artificial intelligence. I joined the team as a member of the discord and quickly began contributing to articles with my own experiences prompting ChatGPT and Claude, and within a few weeks had begun talking more and more often to the creator of the project, Trigaten. 

I became a server administrator and began working on scaling the initiative by creating an organization structure, advertising on various social media platforms, and helping to orchestrate a prompt hacking competition with sponsors such as OpenAI and HuggingFace. Within just six months, we grew to over 40,000 members! I've now stepped back from as significant a role in the community, but I still check in regularly and am proud of the work I did with the original 8-person leadership team of LearnPrompting.
